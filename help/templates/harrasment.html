    <h1 style="border:2px solid black">Harrasment</h1>
    <p>While harassment might seem like an obvious thing when it happens, it’s reported that <b>34% of employees truly do not grasp the concept of harassment</b> or behaviors that lead to a hostile working environment. </p>
    <img class="pic" src="{% static 'image/h1.jpeg' %}">
    <h3 style="border:2px solid black">What Is Harassment?</h3>
 
    <p><b>Harassment is any unwanted behavior </b>, physical or verbal (or even suggested), that makes a reasonable person feel uncomfortable, humiliated, or mentally distressed.</p>

    <p>Depending on state laws, the definition and boundaries for what’s considered harassing behavior may slightly vary.</p>
    <p>During a harassment suit, a lot of things come into consideration. While harassment laws differ between states, most states consider these two main factors when deciding the validity of an accusation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>The perpetrator’s intention (or un-intention) to annoy, threaten, or demean the victim.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repetition and severity of the unwanted action.</li></p>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="border:2px solid black">Types of Harassment and Examples</h3>
    <p>Harassment covers a wide range of unwanted behavior, including physical contact and verbal abuse that causes emotional distress to the harassed. There are seven common types of harassment charges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse</p></li>
        <li><p>Workplace Violence or Harassment</p></li>
        <li><p>Sexual Harassment</p></li>
        <li><p>Civil Harassment</p></li>
        <li><p>Criminal Harassment</p></li>
        <li><p>Cyberbullying or Cyberstalking</p></li>
    </ul>
<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse</h3>
<p>Elder abuse is mostly done by caregivers, such as family or employees at a nursing home. However, elder abuse can also be done by someone close to the elderly, such as fellow residents at a nursing home, neighbors, or family and friends. </p>
<p>Some state courts (California, for example) define elder or dependent adult abuse as an act of abuse against</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>People over 65 years old, or</p> </li>
    <li><p>A dependent adult aged 18 to 64 has mental or physical disabilities preventing them from being able to do normal everyday activities or protect themselves.<p></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The scary thing about elder abuse is that it may not be intentional, especially in the case of neglect or abandonment. An example of unintentional elder abuse may be one with an overwhelmed caregiver, such as a working adult with multiple responsibilities or an elderly person who doesn’t want to burden anyone, thus isolating themselves from their caregivers.</p>

<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Workplace Violence or Harassment</h3>
<p>The term “workplace harassment” covers any and all types of harassment that may happen in a professional setting. It’s not limited to sexual harassment either; anything that makes someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe in their work environment is considered an instance of workplace harassment. </p>
<p>The harasser can be anyone, including co-workers, supervisors, and even customers. The motive also varies, including <b>  discriminatory aspects</b>, such as religion, nationality, sexual orientation, physical appearance, and age. Workplace harassment can even occur at job interviews with a candidate.</p>
<p>The culture of the company, as well as regular training and policies, play a big part in <b> preventing workplace harassment. </b>  </p>
<p>What’s considered acceptable behavior is also highly subjective, which makes the role of regular training and established policies extremely important in cultivating a productive and safe environment for your employees.</p>
<p><b>Regular training</b> provides a baseline for appropriate behavior in the workplace, while harassment policies give victims concrete steps on <b> how to report offensive behaviors.</b></p>
<p>Knowing how to spot sexual harassment and how to handle them can protect your company from liability and your employees from mental distress.</p>

<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Sexual Harassment</h3>
<p>Sexual harassment can mean harassment caused by a person’s sex that makes the <b></b> harassed feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or humiliated.</b>  It can also be considered as any unwanted sexual advances, such as inappropriate comments that are sexual in nature, requests for sexual favors, unwarranted physical touch, or even sexual assault.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment can happen to anyone anywhere, which is why it’s important to <b></b>identify signs of sexual harassment and know how to act.</b></p>
<p>In the workplace, <b>there are two common types of sexual harassment:</b> quid pro quo and <b>hostile work environment.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Quid pro quo sexual harassment refers to the action of exchanging sexual favors for something, which can be a benefit or prevention of a detriment.</p></li>
    <li><p>A hostile work environment is any incident or event that leads to general discomfort, humiliation, or fear for those involved. Examples are:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li><p>Sexual or offensive comments </p></li>
            <li><p>Sending inappropriate texts, memos, or images that are sexual or crude in nature
                Sexual innuendos in conversation</p></li>
            <li><p>Sexual innuendos in conversation</p></li>
            <li><p>Unwarranted or unwelcome physical touch such as rubbing, touching, or hugging</p></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Civil Harassment</h3>
<p>Civil harassment is often classified as acts of abuse by someone you don’t have a close relationship with. Abuse by a family member that doesn’t fall under the domestic violence case is also considered a civil harassment case.</p>
<p>The harassment that falls under this category are ones that involve violence or a threat of violence, including stalking, assault, and credible threats.</p>
<p>To protect yourself from civil harassment, you can get a restraining order. Cases of civil harassment may overlap with other categories. For example, threats of violence to an elderly of the age 65 years old or more can be considered as both civil harassment and elder abuse.</p>

<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Criminal Harassment</h3>
<p>Criminal harassment suits are linked to harassment against protective groups that are designed to annoy, harm, or terrorize. The protected groups include people of a certain gender, sexual orientation, race, national origin, religion, age group, or disability.</p>
<p>Unwanted behavior that makes people of certain groups feel unsafe can be categorized as a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the severity and frequency of the action, as well as the intention of the harasser.</p>
<p>For example, <b>a hate crime </b> harassment against a community (such as the LGBTQIA+ community) can be classified as criminal harassment. </p>

<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Cyberbullying or Cyberstalking</h3>
<p>Cyber harassment, or <b>online harassment,</b> refers to acts that are designed to harm, stalk, or terrorize someone through any form of electronic communications, such as social media, text messages, or phone calls. </p>
<p>It’s easier to harass people virtually since it will be hard to track the parties involved. Cyber harassment can include harmful comments, derogatory websites, and untruthful posts, as well as hateful or offensive emails intentionally designed to terrorize a person.</p>
<p>While cyberbullying seems light compared to other forms of harassment, especially since there are no bodily injuries caused, cyberbullying causes significant damage to a person’s mental state. It can also escalate into a physical confrontation. </p>
<p>Cyberbullying can be extremely difficult to detect or identify as there are sometimes privacy laws, restrictions, and rights owners have. This is why it is especially critical to train your entire workforce to avoid and handle all acts of cyberbullying or malicious online activity.</p>
