    <h1 style="border:2px solid black">Eve Teasing</h1>
<p>Eve teasing is a <b>euphemism,</b>  primarily occurring in Indian English, used for <b>public sexual harassment or sexual assault of women by men.</b> The name "Eve" alludes to the Bible's creation story concerning Adam and Eve. </p>

<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Eve teasing in India</h3>
<p>Eve teasing is a serious crime, even if it's not considered as one, as it is harassment of women in public places like the workplace or streets. It can be committed with a sly whistle, casual touch, humming a suggestive song, etc. Indian criminal laws prescribe punishment for the same as it is a gendered crime against women where only men can be the perpetrator. We have also seen Indian films depicting mild teasing accompanied by a song and dance that mostly results in the female protagonist submitting to the male protagonist's advances in the end. So, many youths tend to replicate this example shown on screen in their real lives; hence referred to as the “Roadside Romeos”.</p>
<h3 style="border:2px solid black">Eve teasing meaning</h3>
<p>It is one of the gender-based crimes against women, mostly used as a method of enjoyment for men who sees a woman as an object for fun. It is usually ignored, thinking it is harmless and non-violent, and women usually forget the act after some time. But it must also be considered a serious offence of harassment against women. </p>
<p>From where did the term ‘eve’ in eve teasing come from? Ever wondered? You might have heard about Adam and Eve. So, according to Christian philosophy, Eve is believed to be the first woman that God made on earth.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that all women are generally termed as ‘eve’. Thus the term eve- teasing.</p>

<p>It is always advisable for women to call on 100 (police control room) or 1091, i.e., women's helpline number at the time of the event, or the victim or complainant must immediately visit the nearest police station to register an FIR. After the FIR is registered, the registration number or receipt will be given. The police can never refuse the FIR; after the criminal law amendment act 2013, the provision of zero FIR came up, which requires FIR to be filed in any police station, and the same can be later transferred to the appropriate police station of proper jurisdiction.</p>
